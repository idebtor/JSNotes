# Strict equality (===) vs Loose equality (==)

This is a lecture note adapted from Udacity Course - JavaScript Basics.

When you use three equal signs, ===, no type conversion is done prior to the comparison. If the values are different types, for example, a String and a Number, they can't ever be equal. To return true, the values must be equal and the types must be the same.

Loose equality, ==, checks to see if the two values are the same type and if not, converts to a common type before the conversion. If the types are already the same, there is no difference between the result of === and ==. When they aren't it can cause unexpected results.

Check the [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness) to an article on Mozilla Developer Network to see what values get converted into what.

According to Jacques Favreau, the lead front-end engineer at Udacity, **you should never use ==**. It's a frequent source of bugs. In fact, if a Udacity engineer tries to commit code with ==, it automatically gets rejected.

Though it wasn't mentioned in the video, the same conditions apply for strict inequality (!==) and loose inequality (!=). Loose inequality is more forgiving than loose equality so you might not see strict inequality as often.
